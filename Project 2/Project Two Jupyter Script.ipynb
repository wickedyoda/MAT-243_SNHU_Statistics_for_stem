    "You are a data analyst for a basketball team and have access to a large set of historical data that you can use to analyze performance patterns. The coach of the team and your management have requested that you perform several hypothesis tests to statistically validate claims about your team's performance. This analysis will provide evidence for these claims and help make key decisions to improve the performance of the team. You will use the Python programming language to perform the statistical analyses and then prepare a report of your findings for the teamâ€™s management. Since the managers are not data analysts, you will need to interpret your findings and describe their practical implications. \n",

The higher the number, the higher the relative skill of a team.\n",

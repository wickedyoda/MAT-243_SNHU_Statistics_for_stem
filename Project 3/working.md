In this project, we are exploring a dataset that contains information about basketball games played by a specific team across different years. The data set includes variables such as the year of the game, the team's name, the number of points scored by both the team and their opponents, the location of the game, and the outcome of the game. We will be using this data to gain insights into the performance of the team, as well as to answer specific research questions about the team's skills and game strategies. The analyses that we will be running in this project include descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and inferential statistics, which will help us draw conclusions about the team's performance and test our research hypotheses.

Data exploration paragraph:

1. What variables are included in the data set?
2. How many observations are in the data set?
3. What is the time frame for the data set?

The dataset includes several variables, including game_id, year_id, fran_id, pts, opp_pts, elo_n, opp_elo_n, game_location, and game_result. The game_id is a unique identifier for each game played, while the year_id variable represents the year in which the game was played. The fran_id variable indicates the name of the team, while pts and opp_pts represent the number of points scored by the team and their opponents, respectively. The elo_n and opp_elo_n variables represent the relative skill levels of the team and their opponents, respectively, while game_location indicates whether the game was played at home or away. Finally, game_result indicates whether the team won or lost the game. There are 246 observations in the dataset, and the time frame for the dataset spans multiple years, although the exact range of years is not specified.

Results paragraph:

1. What are the main results from the analyses?
2. How do the results answer the research questions?
3. What are the implications of the results?

The results of the analyses indicate that the team's mean relative skill level in the years 2013 to 2015 was 1617.48, while the mean number of points scored by the team was 99.92. Additionally, the proportion of games won by the team when scoring more than 102 points in the same time frame was 0.8922. The analyses also revealed that the team's mean relative skill level in the years 1996 to 1998 was significantly higher than their mean relative skill level in the years 2013 to 2015, with a test statistic of 17.07 and a p-value of 0.0. These results provide insights into the team's performance and highlight specific areas where the team excelled or struggled. Additionally, these results can be used to inform decisions about game strategies and team management in the future, with the goal of improving the team's overall performance.

The variable avg_pts_differential represents the average difference in points between the team's score and the opposing team's score. In other words, it is the average margin of victory or loss for a team. For example, if a team has an average point differential of +5, it means that on average, they score 5 more points than their opponent per game. Conversely, if the average point differential is -5, it means that they lose by an average of 5 points per game. This variable is important in understanding how dominant or competitive a team is over a certain period of time.
The variable avg_elo_n represents the team's average Elo rating over a certain period of time. Elo rating is a measure of a team's relative skill level and is used to predict the outcome of a game. It takes into account factors such as the team's win-loss record, the strength of the opponents they have faced, and the margin of victory or loss in each game. The higher the Elo rating, the more skilled the team is considered to be. Thus, the avg_elo_n variable provides insight into the team's overall performance and can be used to compare their skill level with other teams over a certain period of time.

Data visualization techniques, such as scatterplots, are commonly used to study relationship trends between two variables. Scatterplots are an excellent way to visualize and analyze the relationship between two continuous variables. They allow researchers to visually identify any patterns or trends in the data, such as a positive, negative, or no relationship. By using data visualization techniques, researchers can better understand and interpret the relationship between variables.

The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure used to quantify the strength and direction of the association between two variables. It ranges from -1 to +1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation. A correlation coefficient close to -1 or +1 indicates a strong relationship, while a coefficient close to 0 indicates a weak or no relationship. Researchers can use the correlation coefficient to make inferences about the relationship between variables.

The scatterplot of the total number of wins and average relative skill is shown below. The scatterplot shows a general positive trend between the two variables, where teams with higher relative skill tend to have more wins.

The scatterplot and the Pearson correlation coefficient suggest a positive association between the total number of wins and the average relative skill of a team. The positive correlation indicates that as the average relative skill of a team increases, the total number of wins tends to increase as well. The scatterplot shows some variation in the data, indicating that there may be other factors influencing the number of wins besides relative skill. However, the correlation coefficient indicates that there is a significant relationship between the two variables.

Based on a 1% level of significance, the correlation coefficient is statistically significant. The p-value associated with the correlation coefficient is less than 0.01, which means that the correlation between the two variables is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance. This suggests that there is a significant association between the total number of wins and the average relative skill of a team, and the relationship is likely to hold in the population.

## This repo is my class work for applied statistics MAT-243 at Southern New Hampshire University online.

While I am working in class I my files may be a little rough and not easy to follow. I will straighten them up and make sure everything is formatted correctly after class.

Very similar to the repo here: [Lunarestia/MAT243-Applied-Statistics-for-STEM-I](https://github.com/Lunarestia/MAT243-Applied-Statistics-for-STEM-I)

# MAT-243 Applied Statistics for STEM I

Source code (Jupyter Notebook) for my Projects in my MAT-243 STATS for STEM I course at SNHU as well as .csv files (if applicable) and Report.

All Jupyter notebook code is coded in Python. It says HTML because the visual file is an HTML file for each project. I will write and add a .py file with the code at some point and update the info here to reflect that change.

UPDATE: Added .py files for the Jupyter Notebook for Project 1, Project 2 and Project 3.

I found that installing Anaconda (most updated version for python) and running Visual Studio Code from Anaconda, then proceeding to open and run the .py file fixed the error for it not finding the 'numpy' module.

LAst weeks Data and response: 

The multiple regression equation for miles per gallon (mpg) as the response variable with weight (wt) and horsepower (hp) as predictor variables can be represented as:

mpg = 37.5353 - 4.0024 * wt - 0.0308 * hp

The car rental company can use this model to predict a car's fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) based on its weight and horsepower. By inputting the weight and horsepower of a vehicle into this equation, the company can estimate its miles per gallon, which can help the company make informed decisions about the types of cars to purchase or rent out to customers.
The coefficients of correlation between miles per gallon and horsepower are -0.775170, and between miles per gallon and the car's weight are -0.877516. Both coefficients are negative, indicating a strong negative correlation between miles per gallon and weight and horsepower. This suggests that as weight and horsepower increase, miles per gallon decrease. The coefficients of correlation indicate a strong correlation between these variables.

Answer the following: 
	1. Is at least one of the two variables (weight and horsepower) significant in the model? Run the overall F-test and provide your interpretation at 5% level of significance. See Step 5 in the Python script. Include the following in your analysis:
		a. Define the null and alternative hypothesis in mathematical terms and in words.
		b. Report the level of significance.
		c. Include the test statistic and the P-value. (Hint: F-Statistic and Prob (F-Statistic) in the output).
		d. Provide your conclusion and interpretation of the test. Should the null hypothesis be rejected? Why or why not?
	2. What is the slope coefficient for the weight variable? Is this coefficient significant at 5% level of significance (alpha=0.05)? (Hint: Check the P-value, P>|t|, for weight in Python output. Recall that this is the individual t-test for the beta parameter.) See Step 5 in the Python script.
	3. What is the slope coefficient for the horsepower variable? Is this coefficient significant at 5% level of significance (alpha=0.05)? (Hint: Check the P-value, P>|t|, for horsepower in Python output. Recall that this is the individual t-test for the beta parameter.) See Step 5 in the Python script.
	4. What is the purpose of performing individual t-tests after carrying out the overall F-test? What are the differences in the interpretation of the two tests?
	5. What is the coefficient of determination of your multiple regression model from Module Six? Provide appropriate interpretation of this statistic.


My response: 

1. Is at least one of the two variables (weight and horsepower) significant in the model?
	a. The null hypothesis is that none of the variables (weight and horsepower) have a significant effect on miles per gallon. The alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the variables has a significant effect on miles per gallon.
	b. The level of significance is 5%.
	c. The F-statistic is 69.75 and the corresponding p-value is 2.16e-11.
	d. Based on the p-value being less than the level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that at least one of the variables (weight and horsepower) has a significant effect on miles per gallon.

2. The slope coefficient for the weight variable is -3.7564. To determine whether this coefficient is significant at 5% level of significance, we can check the P-value, P>|t|, in the Python output. The P-value for the weight variable is less than 0.05, indicating that the coefficient is statistically significant.

3. The slope coefficient for the horsepower variable is -0.0332. To determine whether this coefficient is significant at 5% level of significance, we can check the P-value, P>|t|, in the Python output. The P-value for the horsepower variable is less than 0.05, indicating that the coefficient is statistically significant.

4. The purpose of performing individual t-tests after carrying out the overall F-test is to determine which variables have a significant effect on the response variable, and to obtain more information about the magnitude and direction of the relationship between each predictor variable and the response variable. The F-test assesses the overall significance of the model, while the t-tests assess the significance of each individual predictor variable.

5. The coefficient of determination (R-squared) of the multiple regression model from Module Six is 0.838. This statistic represents the proportion of the variation in the response variable (miles per gallon) that is explained by the predictor variables (weight and horsepower) in the model. In other words, approximately 84% of the variability in miles per gallon can be explained by the variables weight and horsepower.

1. Null Hypothesis u1=u2 means the test for possible rejection under the assumption that it is true. Alternative Hypothesis claims that it was an effect.
The level of significance is 5% or 0.05
The Test-Statistic 71.22 P-value 0.00 and F-Statistics 1.71e-11
Since the P-value is 0.00 and the level of significance is 0.05, the null hypothesis should be rejected.
2. The the slope coefficient is -3.9864. Since t=-6.305 and the level of significance is 0.05 the null hypothesis should be rejected. The coefficient  is at 5%.
3. The horsepower coefficient -0.0323. The coefficient is at 5%.
4. The t-test assess only one regression coefficient at a time. The F-test assess multiple coefficients. The F-test also determines whether a linear relationship exists with at least one predictor variable. If linear relationship exists, we conduct the t-test to determine if a single variable has an effect
5.Coefficient of determination is 0.841. 
Value for R2 mean that 82.0% of the data fit the regression model. Approximately 82% of the total variation in MPG is accounted for by the linear regression model with HP (horsepower) and WT(weight) as predictors.

Answer: 
	1. Interpret your peer's coefficient of determination. How does it compare with yours?
	2. How do the results of your peers' t-tests compare with yours?
	3. Would you recommend this regression model to the car rental company? Why or why not?

Response: 
	1. My peer's coefficient of determination is 0.841, indicating that approximately 84.1% of the total variation in the dependent variable (mpg) is explained by the independent variables (hp and wt). This is slightly higher than my coefficient of determination of 0.838, indicating that their model may be slightly more effective in explaining the variation in mpg.

	2. The results of my peer's t-tests are consistent with mine. Both our tests indicate that the coefficients for hp and wt are statistically significant at the 5% level of significance, with p-values less than 0.05.

	3. Based on the available information, I would recommend this regression model to the car rental company. The model has a high coefficient of determination, indicating that it is effective in explaining the variation in mpg. The t-tests also indicate that both independent variables (hp and wt) have a statistically significant effect on the dependent variable (mpg), which supports the usefulness of the model for predicting fuel efficiency. However, there may be other factors that the company should consider in addition to horsepower and weight when predicting fuel efficiency, such as the age of the vehicle, the type of fuel used, and driving conditions.


Response 2:
The null hypothesis is a statement that is true unless sufficient data states otherwise. Whereas the alternative hypothesis is a statement that challenges the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis written mathematical is H0 and the alternative hypothesis written mathematical is Ha or H1.

The test statistic for weight is -3.9048 and the test statistic for horsepower is -0.0318. The P-value for weight is 0.000 and the P-value for horsepower is 0.002.

The null hypothesis cannot be rejected because both weight and horsepower are statistically significant based off the F-test. 

The slope coefficient for weight is -6.320. At a 5% level of significance and a P-value of 0.000 this number is significant.

The slope coefficient for horsepower is -10.550. At a 5% level of significance and a P-value of 0.002 this number is significant.

The F-test is applied to a large sample population whereas the t-test is applied to tell whether a single group differs from another group. The F-test compares population variances while the t-test compares population means.

The coefficient of determination of the multiply regression model is 0.82 which means that 82% of the variation of miles per gallon is supported by the independent variables.

Edits after word:
	Your coefficient of determination is 0.841, indicating that approximately 84.1% of the dependent variable (mpg) variation is explained by the independent variables (hp and wt.). This is slightly higher than my coefficient of determination of 0.838, indicating that your model may be more effective in explaining the variation in mpg.
The results of your t-tests are consistent with mine. Both our tests indicate that the coefficients for hp and wt. are statistically significant at the 5% level of significance, with p-values less than 0.05.
Based on the available information, I recommend this regression model to the car rental company. The model has a high coefficient of determination, indicating that it effectively explains the variation in mpg. The t-tests also suggest that both independent variables (hp and wt.) have a statistically significant effect on the dependent variable (mpg), which supports the model's usefulness for predicting fuel efficiency. However, there may be other factors that the company should consider in addition to horsepower and weight when expecting fuel efficiencies, such as the age of the vehicle, the type of fuel used, and driving conditions.
Response 2: 
1.	The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is 0.82, which indicates that 82% of the variation in the dependent variable (mpg) is explained by the independent variables (weight and horsepower). This is slightly lower than the coefficient of determination in your model, which is 0.85. However, both models have a high R-squared value, which means that the independent variables are good predictors of the dependent variable.
2.	The results of your t-tests are consistent with mine in terms of the significance of the coefficients. Both weight and horsepower have a statistically significant effect on mpg, as indicated by the low p-values and high t-values. The t-value for weight in your model is slightly higher (-5.95 vs. -5.94), while the t-value for horsepower is marginally lower (-3.69 vs. -3.68).
3.	Yes, I would recommend this regression model to the car rental company. The model has a high coefficient of determination, indicating that the independent variables are good predictors of the dependent variable. Furthermore, the t-tests for both weight and horsepower show that they have a statistically significant effect on mpg, which means that the car rental company can use these variables to make predictions about fuel efficiency. Additionally, the F-test shows that the overall model is statistically significant, which means that the model as a whole is a good fit for the data.
1.	Rewrite of 2: 
The coefficient of determination (R-squared) for your regression model is 0.82, indicating that 82% of the variation in the dependent variable (mpg) is explained by the independent variables (weight and horsepower). While slightly lower than the coefficient of determination in my model (0.85), both models have high R-squared values, which suggest that the independent variables are reliable predictors of the dependent variable.
2.	The results of your t-tests are consistent with my terms of the significance of the coefficients. Both weight and horsepower have a statistically significant impact on mpg, as shown by the low p-values and high t-values. Although the t-values for weight and horsepower in your model are slightly different than mine, they are both still significant and support the conclusion that these variables have a meaningful effect on fuel efficiency.
3.	Based on the high R-squared value and the significant t-tests for weight and horsepower, it would be recommended to use this regression model for the car rental company. These results demonstrate that the independent variables are effective predictors of the dependent variable, and the F-test indicates that the overall model is statistically significant, which confirms that the model is a good fit for the data. Therefore, the car rental company can utilize this model to make predictions and informed decisions about fuel efficiency.

<h2 class="text-center">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this module, you will meet this learning objective:</p>
<ul class="icon-list-check">
<li>Apply probability distributions to research problems</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-center">Module Overview</h2>
<p>In the previous module, we learned the basic building blocks of inferential statistics, including the differences between a population and a sample, and between parameters and statistics. We also studied data visualization techniques as well as some basic rules of probability. This week, we will answer this question: How can one define probabilities for discrete or continuous random variables? In doing so, we will examine discrete and continuous probability distributions. For example, consider the number of calls received at a call center in a day. In this context, we are dealing with a discrete random variable because the number of calls can only take discrete values (such as 25 calls, 30 calls, and so on). By calculating a probability distribution, we can determine the likelihood of receiving certain numbers of calls in a day. However, in the case of student scores on an exam in a large class, we need to consider continuous random variables. This is because student scores can take continuous values. For example, a student may get a score of 35.5 out of 50. When we calculate a probability distribution for this variable, we can determine the chance of students receiving scores within a specific range, such as between 70 and 85 points.</p>
<p>In this week’s reading, three special continuous probability distributions will be introduced, including the normal distribution, Student’s t-distribution, and the F distribution. We will study the properties of these distributions and learn how to calculate probabilities of critical values as well as determine the critical values when probabilities are given. We will also explore the central limit theorem and its application. This theorem allows us to use the properties of the normal distribution to estimate the mean and the variance of the population. Additionally, it can be used to calculate probabilities irrespective of the type of the distribution of the population.</p>
<p>In your learning activities this week, you will complete the assigned reading and the associated embedded exercises in your zyBooks text. Then, you will be prepared to engage in this week’s discussion and complete the short quiz on this week’s Python functions. Remember that Project One is due in Module Three, so be sure to continue to work on this important assignment and reach out to your instructor with any questions or concerns.</p>
